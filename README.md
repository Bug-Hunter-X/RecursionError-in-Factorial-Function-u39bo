This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the RecursionError. The `factorial.py` file contains a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. It correctly handles the base case (n=0), but fails to handle negative input, resulting in a RecursionError. The solution is provided in `factorialSolution.py`, which adds error handling to gracefully manage negative input.
